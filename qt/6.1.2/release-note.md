Release note  
============  

Qt 6.1 introduces many new features and improvements as well as bugfixes  
over the 6.0.x series. For more details, refer to the online  
documentation included in this distribution. The documentation is also  
available online:  
  
https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/index.html  
  
The Qt version 6.1 series is binary compatible with the 6.0.x series.  
Applications compiled for 6.0 will continue to run with 6.1.  
  
Some of the changes listed in this file include issue tracking numbers  
corresponding to tasks in the Qt Bug Tracker:  
  
https://bugreports.qt.io/  
  
Each of these identifiers can be entered in the bug tracker to obtain  
more information about a particular change.  
  
To make it easier to port to Qt 6, we have created a porting guide to  
summarize those changes and provide guidance to handle them. In the  
guide, you can find links to articles about changes that may affect your  
application and help you transition from Qt 5.15 to Qt 6:

Important Changes  
-----------------  
  
### qtbase  
* 9a186e1da7 Fix license information for libjpeg-turbo  
Clarified that libjpeg-turbo is actually covered by three licenses, not  
only IJG.  
  
* 02a5580292 macOS: allow Qt::AA_DontShowShortcutsInContextMenus  
overrides  
The shortcutVisibleInContextMenu property defaults to the value of the  
Qt::AA_DontShowShortcutsInContextMenus attribute, which in turn defaults  
to the platform integration. To override the default, set the  
application attribute after instantiating QApplication, or override the  
default for each QAction instance.  
  
### qtwayland  
* c0ef4aa9 client: Gracefully handle shutdown and window hiding  
Fixed a crash that could happen when hiding or closing windows while Qt  
Quick was actively rendering on a different thread.  
  
### qt3d  
* eb0011ba1 Fix multi-view picking  
Non rendered entities (due to layer filtering) are no longer pickable  
  
### qtimageformats  
* f111501 Update bundled libtiff to version 4.3.0  
Bundled libtiff was updated to version 4.3.0  
  
### qtvirtualkeyboard  
* 6201217 Fix high CPU utilization caused by key repeat timer  
Fixed high CPU utilization caused by key repeat timer.  
  
* 062e4d0 Disable Windows IME when Qt Virtual Keyboard plugin is loaded  
Disable Windows IME when Qt Virtual Keyboard plugin is loaded  
  
### qtquick3d  
* 4a08fa54 Fix the occlusionMap to be compatible with GLTF2  
This patch changes how occlusionMap works in QQuick3DMaterial.  
Previously occlusionMap influences on all the diffuse colors and  
emissive colors. Now it will not affect punctual lightings.(For now it  
will affect only IBL.) The result of a lancelot test,  
principled/occlusion.qml, will be changed because it does not have  
IBL.(The occlusionMap will be ignored.) There will be 4 rows in the new  
test. Top 2 rows are without IBL, and others are with IBL in their  
materials.
