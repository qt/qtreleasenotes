Release note
============

Qt 6.1 introduces many new features and improvements as well as bugfixes
over the 6.0.x series. For more details, refer to the online
documentation included in this distribution. The documentation is also
available online:

https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/index.html

The Qt version 6.1 series is binary compatible with the 6.0.x series.
Applications compiled for 6.0 will continue to run with 6.1.

Some of the changes listed in this file include issue tracking numbers
corresponding to tasks in the Qt Bug Tracker:

https://bugreports.qt.io/

Each of these identifiers can be entered in the bug tracker to obtain
more information about a particular change.

To make it easier to port to Qt 6, we have created a porting guide to
summarize those changes and provide guidance to handle them. In the
guide, you can find links to articles about changes that may affect your
application and help you transition from Qt 5.15 to Qt 6:

Important Changes
_________________

[qtbase]
612a01be65 Deprecate QScopedPointer::take()
- The take() function has been deprecated. This was an API mistake, as
it allowed the pointer/pointee to escape from the scope, defeating the
point of the QScopedPointer class. If you need such semantics, use
std::unique_ptr (and call release()).

d8602ce58b QFont: Prefer setFamilies() over setFamily()
- Indicated that setFamilies/families is preferred over setFamily/family
to ensure that font family names are preserved when spaces, commas and
so on are used in the name.

fb6b7869e8 QPoint(F): add support for structured binding
- QPoint is usable in a structured binding.

c63669bb8c QLayout: add a way to unset user-defined contents margins
- Added unsetContentsMargins().

8ae9431c79 QMargins(F): add support for structured binding
- QMargins is usable in a structured binding.

54875be84d Add convenience functions for QFuture creation
- Add convenience functions to create a ready QFuture and a QFuture with
an exception

1ff25785ff Avoid integer overflow and division by zero
- Pen patterns are restrained to a maximum length and values of 1024,
fixing oss-fuzz issue 25310.

3f8896d77e QSet: add missing insert-with-hint
- Added insert() overload taking an insertion hint, for STL
compatibility.

5771591fbc QString/QByteArray: add erase() for iterators
- Added erase().

3a4115d123 Return a more useful date-time on parser failure in spring-
forward gap
- Restored pre-5.15.0 behavior when parsing a date-time from a string
(and document what it implies): if the string has the right form but
represents a date-time that was skipped by a time-zone transition (e.g.
a DST spring-forward), the invalid date-time object returned can, none
the less, be used to recover a near-by date-time that may be more useful
in some cases. From 5.15.0 to 5.15.2 and in 6.0.0, a default-constructed
QDateTime was returned in place of this more informative invalid date-
time.

d27d2b5d72 QMetaProperty::typeName: use name from metatype
- QMetaProperty::typeName returns now always the same name as name() of
the corresponding metatype. This can cause a change for enum properties
which were not fully-qualified.

d982fdfca4 QHeaderView: allow un-sorting of models
- Added the sortIndicatorClearable property. Setting this property
allows the user to clear the sort indicator on a section, resetting the
model to its default ordering.

81e893fb2d QHash: support std::hash as hashing function
- QHash, QMultiHash and QSet now support for key types anything that can
be hashed via std::hash, instead of always requiring a qHash() overload.

1158ff67b4 QSslSocket::verify: do not alter the default configuration
- QSslSocket::verify - do not change the default configuration

c176525f13 Sequential general purpose containers: add erase/erase_if
- Added erase() and erase_if(), for consistent container erasure. Added
removeIf() as a method, complementing removeOne() / removeAll().

62dad9be9e QSet: add erase_if
- Added erase_if() for consistent container erasure. Added removeIf() as
a method.

b2ea30dde0 QString/QByteArray: add erase/erase_if
- Added erase() and erase_if() for consistent container erasure.

e12e2b43b7 Associative containers: add erase_if
- Added removeIf() and erase_if().

427da06414 QRE: discourage users from assuming that QRE stores the
subject
- QRegularExpression takes a shallow copy of a QString subject when
matching over it. This means that users can destroy or modify the string
data while still having match results over it. This behavior is
deprecated; in a future version of Qt, QRegularExpression will no longer
take a copy. Note that behavior has always been undocumented and users
were never supposed to modify a subject string while match objects were
alive on it. In practice, it's very unlikely that your code is relying
on the existing behavior.

a1a55d5b93 QTestLib: add a abort-on-fail environment variable
- When the QTEST_FATAL_FAIL environment variable is set to a non-zero
value, a test immediately aborts its execution. This is useful to debug
intermittent failures.

509c257521 PCRE: update to 10.36
- PCRE2 has been updated to version 10.36.

2b8674a2fc Make the overflow math functions public
- The overflow-safe math functions qAddOverflow(), qSubOverflow(),
qMulOverflow() were added.

4d94384612 QHeaderView: respect the font role while calculating the
elided text
- QStyleOptionHeader got a new member textElideMode.

7c3208c97d QString: fix count(QRegularExpression)
- Fixed a corner case when using QString::count(QRegularExpression),
causing an empty in the last position not to be accounted for in the
returned result.

ce0b767310 QStringView: add some QRegularExpression-related overloads
- Added the indexOf(), contains(), lastIndexOf() and count() methods
taking a QRegularExpression.

6dac45b246 QSocketNotifier: extend API to provide more flexible startup
- Added setSocket() and an additional constructor which requires no
socket.

30811f6428 Fix qt_alphaVersion and qt_opaqueVersion in the trivial case
- Opaque pixmaps on devices with a non-standard opaque format will now
correctly match format for faster blitting. Same with semitransparent
pixmaps on devices with a non-standard semitransparent format.

c88905f0a9 Disallow construction of QPropertyBinding from a property
- It was possible to create a QPropertyBinding from a property; this
would steal any set binding from the property or create an invalid
binding if none was set. Use makePropertyBinding if you want to to
create a binding which depends on the property's value, or takeBinding
if you want to repurpose the property's binding.

04c34eb799 QProcess: allow merged channels forwarding for detached
processes
- Added support for QProcess::MergedChannels mode with startDetached().

e334d6f9a7 QProcess: allow pipelining for detached processes
- Added support for setStandardOutputProcess() with startDetached().

6974737695 Change QLineF::setLength() to work whenever length() is non-
zero
- QLineF::setLength() will now set the length if the line's length() is
non-zero. Previously, it was documented to only set the length if
isNull() was false; this is a fuzzy check, so isNull() could be true for
a line with non-zero length().

b211148e4b Sql ODBC driver: add direct support for float and short
datatype
- The ODBC driver now properly maps QMetaType::Float to real sql
datatype and QMetaType::Short to smallint

f8f629cc13 QSql/QSqlite: return extended error codes by default
- The plugin now returns the extended error codes by default.

6a3f8cbc3a Use design metrics when adding text to QPainterPath
- Fixed an issue where QPainterPath::addText() would get inconsistent
kerning for smaller font sizes when hinting is enabled.

376e3bd8ec Introduce QUrlResourceProvider to load resources for HTML
- Introduced QUrlResourceProvider that allows to load resources for
HTML. It is intended to replace the use of
QTextDocument::loadResource().

b2a3389cfe Extend qIsInf() and friends to handle integral types sensibly
- qIsInf(), qIsNaN() and qIsFinite() now, like std::isinf() and friends,
accept integral types (returning false, false and true, respectively) as
well as floating-point ones.

539553a572 QTestlib/JUnit XML: Log most messages to standard output
instead of error output
- In JUnit XML, output that is not a warning/error is now logged under
<system-out> instead of <system-err>.

cfd935fe6c Fix XCB launch key mapping
- XF86LaunchXX keys have been remapped, so the Qt names and X11 names
match, instead of being 2 off.

f1465c621c QLocale: Allow direct conversion to language, country, and
script codes
- Added static languageToCode(), countryToCode() scriptToCode() methods
that convert enum values to the respective ISO code strings.

5a0e5521e4 QVectorND: make some constructors explicit
- The QVector2D/3D/4D converting constructors from another QVectorND now
explicit. This was done to prevent a category of bugs resulting from
operations accidentally mixing QVectorND objects.

50c63446f5 Fix problems with offset-derived ids for QTimeZone
- QTimeZone instances created by offset from UTC (in seconds) shall now
only include minutes in their ID when the offset is not a whole number
of hours. They shall also include the seconds in their ID when the
offset is not a whole number of minutes.

aa09bea00c control scrolling of QTabBar using StyleHint
- Added SH_TabBar_AllowWheelScrolling as a style hint to enable/disable
cycling through tabs using the scroll wheel. This defaults to true in
all styles except the macOS one so there is no change in existing
behavior.

722a7dda56 SQLite: Update to 3.34.0
- Updated to 3.34.0

d79a9b1a4f Implement vertical subpixel positioning where available
- Added render hint flag QPainter::VerticalSubpixelPositioning which
will position text at subpixel positions vertically whenever supported.
In absence of this, text position will be rounded vertically as before.

e7c028bb9c QLocale: Allow direct conversion from language, country, and
script codes
- Added static codeToLanguage(), codeToCountry(), codeToScript() methods
that convert ISO code strings to the respective enum values.

b08368d99f Add qHypot() to qmath.h, exposing and extending std::hypot()
- Header <QMath> now provides qHypot(), an implementation of
std::hypot() taking arbitrarily many numeric values, including support
for qfloat16, while avoiding the overflow and underflow problems that
arise when naively taking the square root of a sum of squares.

4e60681c87 Make QJniObject and QJniEnvironment public API
- Add new QJniObject, QJniEnvironment and QJniExceptionCleaner APIs.

065527825e Remove false Q_UNREACHABLE from shaping code
- Fixed a possible crash with certain fonts when shaping strings
consisting only of control characters.

9807573764 Fix crash when requesting A32 glyph on Wayland
- Fixed crash when calling QRawFont::alphaMapForGlyph() with subpixel
antialiasing on Wayland.

dca5a2ca39 Restore pre-Qt6 QList::fill() behavior
- Fixed QList::fill() regression introduced in 6.0: calling fill() with
size < current list size wouldn't truncate the list

f576e22f6e QMatrix4x4: deprecate operator*(QMatrix4x4,
QVector3D/QPoint(F))
- operator* between a QMatrix4x4 and a QVector3D, QPoint, or QPointF has
been deprecated in favor of map() and mapVector().

2c55e121c2 QMatrix4x4: deprecate operator*(QVector3D, QMatrix4x4)
- The multiplication operator (operator*) between a QVector3D and a
QMatrix4x4 has been deprecated. User code needs to extend the QVector3D
to a QVector4D first (by specifying the intended w coordinate), and then
multiply the QVector4D by the matrix.

64c47d7f61 QProcess::startDetached: set the error condition on failure
to start
- If a startDetached() fails to start the target application, the
QProcess object should now have a proper error string in errorString().

c515ee178f Move build tools to libexec instead of the bin dir
- Tools that are called by the build system and are unlikely to be
called by the user are now installed to the libexec directory.

82f4c5ebe5 QNetworkInterface/Unix: fix DNS eligibility of global
addresses
- Fixed the reporting the "DNS eligibility" factor
(QNetworkAddressEntry::dnsEligibility) for global IP addresses.
Previously, QNetworkInterface interface erroneously reported all global
addresses as eligible, regardless of whether they had already been
deprecated by the OS or were temporary in the first place.

a441548f42 Update bundled libjpeg-turbo to version 2.0.6
- libjpeg-turbo was updated to version 2.0.6

97ffc571ae Support family names that end/start with space
- Fixed matching against fonts which has a family name that ends or
starts with a space.

474ec0ac9a SQLite: Update to 3.35.2
- Updated SQLite to v3.35.2

86729df9d4 QTextHtmlParserNode: Limit colspan to avoid segfault
- QTextDocument::setHtml: column spans are limited to 20480, an
arbitrarily high but reasonable value.

6e8a74712f QString: add missing char8_t* constructor / fromUtf8
overloads
- Added a constructor and a fromUtf8() overload taking a `const char8_t
*` argument.

[qtdeclarative]
db0b7cfcb2 qmlformat: Add indent options
- Added option to customize indentation.

f8f39f6ee4 Find qml imports inside subdirectories of symlinks
- Follow sybmolic links in findQmlImportsInDirectory

6eb35df60e QML engine: Deprecate DefaultMethod
- Assigning an object to a signal handler is deprecated. Instead, create
the object, give it an id, and call the desired slot from the signal
handler. For instance, instead of of ListView.onRemove:
SequentialAnimation {...} use SequentialAnimation {id: removeAnimation;
...} ListView.onRemove: removeAnimation.start() A warning will be
printed whenever an assignment of an object to a signal handler occurs.
The warning can be controlled via the qt.qml.defaultmethod logging
category.

33c87736db Kill Flickable's wheel momentum if angleDeltas not multiples
of 120
- Flickable now tries to detect whether you're using a "clicky" wheel on
a desktop mouse.  A laptop trackpad can generate QWheelEvent::angleDelta
values that are not multiples of 120; in that case, smooth scrolling
with momentum is disabled, to avoid losing control of scrolling. Set the
environment variable QT_QUICK_FLICKABLE_WHEEL_MOMENTUM_ENABLED=0 to opt
out of the old behavior entirely, or set it to 1 to opt in
unconditionally.

cf3e0559b0 qmlformat: Remove import sorting
- Remove import sorting and the (now obsolete) -n parameter to disable
it

6f181768a3 Add a QJSManagedValue
- The new QJSManagedValue should be used instead of QJSValue for
manipulating properties and prototypes of JavaScript values, as well as
for calling JavaScript functions.

7c648280bb doc: explain QQItem event delivery, handlers,
setAcceptTouchEvents()
- When subclassing QQuickItem, you should call
setAcceptTouchEvents(true) if you need the item to receive touch events.
It will be required in Qt 6.

831efa14e9 Update hovered on disabled QQuickItems
- QQuickItem::hovered will now update even when the item is disabled.

c1bcaca07f QJSEngine: Add a function to throw a pre-generated error
object
- QJSEngine has gained an additional overload to the throwError()
method, with the effect that calling throwError() with a character
literal as argument is now ambiguous. You should explicitly construct a
QString instead.

06d819cd71 QML: Warn about variables being used before their declaration
- QML warns about JavaScript variables being used before their
declaration now. This is almost always a mistake. It is particularly
dangerous in the presence of injected signal parameters because
qmlcachegen cannot identify a name collision between an injected signal
parameter and a variable being used before its declaration. It therefore
miscompiles such code. You can turn off the deprecation warning using
the "qt.qml.compiler" logging category.

b7412dc866 QML: Warn about usage of injected signal parameters
- The automatic injection of signal parameters into signal handlers is
deprecated. This is because we cannot determine the names of the signal
parameters at compile time. Furthermore, also for human readers it is
difficult to discern between arguments, context properties, properties
of the current object, and properties of the root object of the
component. Requiring the signal parameters to be explicitly named
resolves some of this confusion. You can turn the deprecation warning
off using the "qt.qml.compiler" and "qt.qml.context" logging categories.

[qtwayland]
38fc568b Fix leaked subsurface wayland items
- Fixed a memory leak when creating subsurfaces.

bd1713ef Fix memory leak in QWaylandGLContext
- Fixed a memory leak when creating QOpenGLContexts on Wayland and using
the wayland-egl backend.

3aa1b351 Fix race condition when attaching client to text input
- Fixed a problem where a virtual keyboard would not be updated
correctly if two clients were started at almost the same time.

[qt3d]
c6aec09f4 Introduce QGeometryRenderer::sortIndex
- Add sortIndex property to QGeometryRenderer to explicitly control the
order in which entities are rendered

86eb86514 Fix feature names in cmake
- Configuration time command line arguments have changed to use dashes
rather than underscores

[qtimageformats]
d1819db Fix linking of WebP through CMake API
- Fixed an error that might have led to not compiling webp plugin when
configuring Qt yourself.

2932b4c Update bundled libwebp to version 1.2.0
- Update bundled libwebp to version 1.2.0

16601c1 Update bundled libtiff to version 4.2.0
- Bundled libtiff was updated to version 4.2.0

[qtquickcontrols2]
4a718113a Allow style to be set to "Default" for compatibility
- Setting the style to "Default" now behaves the same way as not
specifying a style; a relevant style will be chosen based on the
platform. To use the style previously known as "Default", use "Basic".

df33c79fb Reset the opacity and scale properties after the exit
transition
- After the exit transition is finished, then the opacity and scale
properties will be reset to their values before the enter transition is
started.

[qtcharts]
227020b1 Remove charts namespace for Qt6
- Use QT_NAMESPACE as other modules.

[qtvirtualkeyboard]
dfb10af Move qtvirtualkeyboard over to the new configure system
- The build system was switched to the new configure system. See
documentation for updated instructions.

90d64de Fix activation of input panel when initial active focus is set
- It is now possible to open the input panel implicitly when activating
the window. Before, this failed because the "visible" state was reset
(due to a bug) during activation.

6ce4fc1 Sort language list by active languages
- The language list can now be sorted in any order by specifying the
order in the active language list.

6421dbd Add new setting for user data path
- Added new property to settings VirtualKeyboardSettings.userDataPath.
This allows the application or middleware to change the path to user
files at runtime. Added also a signal to indicate user data reset - when
the application triggers the signal, the virtual keyboard closes all
files in the user's directory.

5b81a28 Add new setting for handwriting timeout
- Add new settings VirtualKeyboardSettings.hwrTimeoutForAlphabetic and
VirtualKeyboardSettings.hwrTimeoutForCjk to allow the application to
adjust the handwriting recognition timeout.

e923b4f Add new setting for input method hints
- Add new setting VirtualKeyboardSettings.inputMethodHints, which allows
the application to set persistent application wide input method hints.

1477134 Add new setting for disabling handwriting mode
- Add new setting VirtualKeyboardSettings.disableHandwritingMode, which
allows to disable handwriting mode at runtime.

c82d462 Add new settings defaultInputMethodDisabled,
defaultDictionaryDisabled
- Add new settings VirtualKeyboardSettings.defaultInputMethodDisabled
and VirtualKeyboardSettings.defaultDictionaryDisabled.

6e83e31 Add new method clearInputMode() to input method v2
- Added new method clearInputMode() to input method.

87d6c20 Add generic dictionary API for the virtual keyboard v2
- Added a generic dictionary API. The API allows applications to
create/update/remove dictionaries at runtime. The desired dictionaries
can be activated from the application. The implementation of the
dictionaries depends on the input method. A typical use case for this
API would be a phone book.

3a703e5 Add new function Trace.startHideTimer
- Added new function Trace.startHideTimer(), which allows the input
method to hide trace before destroying the trace object.

32c025d Add new key type FlickKey v2
- Added a new key type FlickKey.

d22313c Add Stroke and Romaji values to the InputMode enumeration
- Added Stroke and Romaji values to the InputMode enumeration.

d3dbc82 CMake: Fix pinyin and tcime resource bundling
- Added vkb- prefix to no-bundle-pinyin no-bundle-tcime command line
options (e.g. vkb-no-bundle-pinyin) and restored them as part of
configuration.

[qtscxml]
96a69e7 Only return uniquely named services from invokedServices()
- If you have multiple equally named children of an invoked service,
only one of them will be included in the "children" property now.
Before, the fact that QVariantMap was actually a multimap was used to
squeeze all of them in.

cfb46e8 Name and mark the scxml datamodel plugin headers as private
- The QScxmlEcmaScriptDataModel class is no longer part of the public
API. This relates to moving the ecmascript datamodel's QML dependency
from build time to runtime.

[qtquick3d]
c460e497 balsam: Return error codes
- balsam now returns an error code if no source was given, or the
conversion failed.

[qtshadertools]
bbfcb67 Augment attributions for SPIRV-Cross
- Changed identified license of SPIRV-Cross to Apache License 2.0 and
Khronos License, and fixed copyright attributions.

4e1806a Augment attributions for glslang
- Changed identified licenses in glslang to BSD 3-Clause "New" or
"Revised" License, and Khronos License, and Apache License 2.0, and GNU
General Public License v3.0 or later with Bison exception 2.2, and
NVIDIA 2002 License. Augment Copyright information with details from
file headers.

[qt5compat]
94966f0 Move graphical effects to qt5compat
- Added version of Qt Graphical Effects for compatibility with Qt 5
code. This can be accessed by importing "Qt5Compat.GraphicalEffects"
