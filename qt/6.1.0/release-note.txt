===========

Qt 6.1 introduces many new features and improvements as well as bugfixes
over the 6.0.x series. For more details, refer to the online documentation
included in this distribution. The documentation is also available online:

https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/index.html

The Qt version 6.1 series is binary compatible with the 6.0.x series.
Applications compiled for 6.0 will continue to run with 6.1.

Some of the changes listed in this file include issue tracking numbers
corresponding to tasks in the Qt Bug Tracker:

https://bugreports.qt.io/

Each of these identifiers can be entered in the bug tracker to obtain more
information about a particular change.

To make it easier to port to Qt 6, we have created a porting guide to
summarize those changes and provide guidance to handle them. In the guide, you

Important Changes
_________________

[qtbase]
612a01be65 Deprecate QScopedPointer::take()
    The take() function has been deprecated. This was an API mistake, as it allowed the pointer/pointee to escape from the scope, defeating the point of the QScopedPointer class. If you need such semantics, use std::unique_ptr (and call release()).

d8602ce58b QFont: Prefer setFamilies() over setFamily()
    Indicated that setFamilies/families is preferred over setFamily/family to ensure that font family names are preserved when spaces, commas and so on are used in the name.

fb6b7869e8 QPoint(F): add support for structured binding
    QPoint is usable in a structured binding.

c63669bb8c QLayout: add a way to unset user-defined contents margins
    Added unsetContentsMargins().

8ae9431c79 QMargins(F): add support for structured binding
    QMargins is usable in a structured binding.

54875be84d Add convenience functions for QFuture creation
    Add convenience functions to create a ready QFuture and a QFuture with an exception

1ff25785ff Avoid integer overflow and division by zero
    Pen patterns are restrained to a maximum length and values of 1024, fixing oss-fuzz issue 25310.

3f8896d77e QSet: add missing insert-with-hint
    Added insert() overload taking an insertion hint, for STL compatibility.

5771591fbc QString/QByteArray: add erase() for iterators
    Added erase().

3a4115d123 Return a more useful date-time on parser failure in spring-forward gap
    Restored pre-5.15.0 behavior when parsing a date-time from a string (and document what it implies): if the string has the right form but represents a date-time that was skipped by a time-zone transition (e.g. a DST spring-forward), the invalid date-time object returned can, none the less, be used to recover a near-by date-time that may be more useful in some cases. From 5.15.0 to 5.15.2 and in 6.0.0, a default-constructed QDateTime was returned in place of this more informative invalid date-time.

d27d2b5d72 QMetaProperty::typeName: use name from metatype
    QMetaProperty::typeName returns now always the same name as name() of the corresponding metatype. This can cause a change for enum properties which were not fully-qualified.

d982fdfca4 QHeaderView: allow un-sorting of models
    Added the sortIndicatorClearable property. Setting this property allows the user to clear the sort indicator on a section, resetting the model to its default ordering.

81e893fb2d QHash: support std::hash as hashing function
    QHash, QMultiHash and QSet now support for key types anything that can be hashed via std::hash, instead of always requiring a qHash() overload.

1158ff67b4 QSslSocket::verify: do not alter the default configuration
    QSslSocket::verify - do not change the default configuration

c176525f13 Sequential general purpose containers: add erase/erase_if
    Added erase() and erase_if(), for consistent container erasure. Added removeIf() as a method, complementing removeOne() / removeAll().

62dad9be9e QSet: add erase_if
    Added erase_if() for consistent container erasure. Added removeIf() as a method.

b2ea30dde0 QString/QByteArray: add erase/erase_if
    Added erase() and erase_if() for consistent container erasure.

e12e2b43b7 Associative containers: add erase_if
    Added removeIf() and erase_if().

427da06414 QRE: discourage users from assuming that QRE stores the subject
    QRegularExpression takes a shallow copy of a QString subject when matching over it. This means that users can destroy or modify the string data while still having match results over it. This behavior is deprecated; in a future version of Qt, QRegularExpression will no longer take a copy. Note that behavior has always been undocumented and users were never supposed to modify a subject string while match objects were alive on it. In practice, it's very unlikely that your code is relying on the existing behavior.

a1a55d5b93 QTestLib: add a abort-on-fail environment variable
    When the QTEST_FATAL_FAIL environment variable is set to a non-zero value, a test immediately aborts its execution. This is useful to debug intermittent failures.

509c257521 PCRE: update to 10.36
    PCRE2 has been updated to version 10.36.

2b8674a2fc Make the overflow math functions public
    The overflow-safe math functions qAddOverflow(), qSubOverflow(), qMulOverflow() were added.

4d94384612 QHeaderView: respect the font role while calculating the elided text
    QStyleOptionHeader got a new member textElideMode.

7c3208c97d QString: fix count(QRegularExpression)
    Fixed a corner case when using QString::count(QRegularExpression), causing an empty in the last position not to be accounted for in the returned result.

ce0b767310 QStringView: add some QRegularExpression-related overloads
    Added the indexOf(), contains(), lastIndexOf() and count() methods taking a QRegularExpression.

6dac45b246 QSocketNotifier: extend API to provide more flexible startup
    Added setSocket() and an additional constructor which requires no socket.

30811f6428 Fix qt_alphaVersion and qt_opaqueVersion in the trivial case
    Opaque pixmaps on devices with a non-standard opaque format will now correctly match format for faster blitting. Same with semitransparent pixmaps on devices with a non-standard semitransparent format.

c88905f0a9 Disallow construction of QPropertyBinding from a property
    It was possible to create a QPropertyBinding from a property; this would steal any set binding from the property or create an invalid binding if none was set. Use makePropertyBinding if you want to to create a binding which depends on the property's value, or takeBinding if you want to repurpose the property's binding.

04c34eb799 QProcess: allow merged channels forwarding for detached processes
    Added support for QProcess::MergedChannels mode with startDetached().

e334d6f9a7 QProcess: allow pipelining for detached processes
    Added support for setStandardOutputProcess() with startDetached().

6974737695 Change QLineF::setLength() to work whenever length() is non-zero
    QLineF::setLength() will now set the length if the line's length() is non-zero. Previously, it was documented to only set the length if isNull() was false; this is a fuzzy check, so isNull() could be true for a line with non-zero length().

b211148e4b Sql ODBC driver: add direct support for float and short datatype
    The ODBC driver now properly maps QMetaType::Float to real sql datatype and QMetaType::Short to smallint

f8f629cc13 QSql/QSqlite: return extended error codes by default
    The plugin now returns the extended error codes by default.

6a3f8cbc3a Use design metrics when adding text to QPainterPath
    Fixed an issue where QPainterPath::addText() would get inconsistent kerning for smaller font sizes when hinting is enabled.

376e3bd8ec Introduce QUrlResourceProvider to load resources for HTML
    Introduced QUrlResourceProvider that allows to load resources for HTML. It is intended to replace the use of QTextDocument::loadResource().

b2a3389cfe Extend qIsInf() and friends to handle integral types sensibly
    qIsInf(), qIsNaN() and qIsFinite() now, like std::isinf() and friends, accept integral types (returning false, false and true, respectively) as well as floating-point ones.

539553a572 QTestlib/JUnit XML: Log most messages to standard output instead of error output
    In JUnit XML, output that is not a warning/error is now logged under <system-out> instead of <system-err>.

cfd935fe6c Fix XCB launch key mapping
    XF86LaunchXX keys have been remapped, so the Qt names and X11 names match, instead of being 2 off.

f1465c621c QLocale: Allow direct conversion to language, country, and script codes
    Added static languageToCode(), countryToCode() scriptToCode() methods that convert enum values to the respective ISO code strings.

5a0e5521e4 QVectorND: make some constructors explicit
    The QVector2D/3D/4D converting constructors from another QVectorND now explicit. This was done to prevent a category of bugs resulting from operations accidentally mixing QVectorND objects.

50c63446f5 Fix problems with offset-derived ids for QTimeZone
    QTimeZone instances created by offset from UTC (in seconds) shall now only include minutes in their ID when the offset is not a whole number of hours. They shall also include the seconds in their ID when the offset is not a whole number of minutes.

aa09bea00c control scrolling of QTabBar using StyleHint
    Added SH_TabBar_AllowWheelScrolling as a style hint to enable/disable cycling through tabs using the scroll wheel. This defaults to true in all styles except the macOS one so there is no change in existing behavior.

722a7dda56 SQLite: Update to 3.34.0
    Updated to 3.34.0

d79a9b1a4f Implement vertical subpixel positioning where available
    Added render hint flag QPainter::VerticalSubpixelPositioning which will position text at subpixel positions vertically whenever supported. In absence of this, text position will be rounded vertically as before.

e7c028bb9c QLocale: Allow direct conversion from language, country, and script codes
    Added static codeToLanguage(), codeToCountry(), codeToScript() methods that convert ISO code strings to the respective enum values.

b08368d99f Add qHypot() to qmath.h, exposing and extending std::hypot()
    Header <QMath> now provides qHypot(), an implementation of std::hypot() taking arbitrarily many numeric values, including support for qfloat16, while avoiding the overflow and underflow problems that arise when naively taking the square root of a sum of squares.

4e60681c87 Make QJniObject and QJniEnvironment public API
    Add new QJniObject, QJniEnvironment and QJniExceptionCleaner APIs.

065527825e Remove false Q_UNREACHABLE from shaping code
    Fixed a possible crash with certain fonts when shaping strings consisting only of control characters.

9807573764 Fix crash when requesting A32 glyph on Wayland
    Fixed crash when calling QRawFont::alphaMapForGlyph() with subpixel antialiasing on Wayland.

dca5a2ca39 Restore pre-Qt6 QList::fill() behavior
    Fixed QList::fill() regression introduced in 6.0: calling fill() with size < current list size wouldn't truncate the list

f576e22f6e QMatrix4x4: deprecate operator*(QMatrix4x4, QVector3D/QPoint(F))
    operator* between a QMatrix4x4 and a QVector3D, QPoint, or QPointF has been deprecated in favor of map() and mapVector().

2c55e121c2 QMatrix4x4: deprecate operator*(QVector3D, QMatrix4x4)
    The multiplication operator (operator*) between a QVector3D and a QMatrix4x4 has been deprecated. User code needs to extend the QVector3D to a QVector4D first (by specifying the intended w coordinate), and then multiply the QVector4D by the matrix.

64c47d7f61 QProcess::startDetached: set the error condition on failure to start
    If a startDetached() fails to start the target application, the QProcess object should now have a proper error string in errorString().

c515ee178f Move build tools to libexec instead of the bin dir
    Tools that are called by the build system and are unlikely to be called by the user are now installed to the libexec directory.

82f4c5ebe5 QNetworkInterface/Unix: fix DNS eligibility of global addresses
    Fixed the reporting the "DNS eligibility" factor (QNetworkAddressEntry::dnsEligibility) for global IP addresses. Previously, QNetworkInterface interface erroneously reported all global addresses as eligible, regardless of whether they had already been deprecated by the OS or were temporary in the first place.

a441548f42 Update bundled libjpeg-turbo to version 2.0.6
    libjpeg-turbo was updated to version 2.0.6

97ffc571ae Support family names that end/start with space
    Fixed matching against fonts which has a family name that ends or starts with a space.

474ec0ac9a SQLite: Update to 3.35.2
    Updated SQLite to v3.35.2

86729df9d4 QTextHtmlParserNode: Limit colspan to avoid segfault
    QTextDocument::setHtml: column spans are limited to 20480, an arbitrarily high but reasonable value.

6e8a74712f QString: add missing char8_t* constructor / fromUtf8 overloads
    Added a constructor and a fromUtf8() overload taking a `const char8_t *` argument.


[qtdeclarative]
db0b7cfcb2 qmlformat: Add indent options
    Added option to customize indentation.

f8f39f6ee4 Find qml imports inside subdirectories of symlinks
    Follow sybmolic links in findQmlImportsInDirectory

6eb35df60e QML engine: Deprecate DefaultMethod
    Assigning an object to a signal handler is deprecated. Instead, create the object, give it an id, and call the desired slot from the signal handler. For instance, instead of of ListView.onRemove: SequentialAnimation {...} use SequentialAnimation {id: removeAnimation; ...} ListView.onRemove: removeAnimation.start() A warning will be printed whenever an assignment of an object to a signal handler occurs. The warning can be controlled via the qt.qml.defaultmethod logging category.

33c87736db Kill Flickable's wheel momentum if angleDeltas not multiples of 120
    Flickable now tries to detect whether you're using a "clicky" wheel on a desktop mouse.  A laptop trackpad can generate QWheelEvent::angleDelta values that are not multiples of 120; in that case, smooth scrolling with momentum is disabled, to avoid losing control of scrolling. Set the environment variable QT_QUICK_FLICKABLE_WHEEL_MOMENTUM_ENABLED=0 to opt out of the old behavior entirely, or set it to 1 to opt in unconditionally.

cf3e0559b0 qmlformat: Remove import sorting
    Remove import sorting and the (now obsolete) -n parameter to disable it

6f181768a3 Add a QJSManagedValue
    The new QJSManagedValue should be used instead of QJSValue for manipulating properties and prototypes of JavaScript values, as well as for calling JavaScript functions.

7c648280bb doc: explain QQItem event delivery, handlers, setAcceptTouchEvents()
    When subclassing QQuickItem, you should call setAcceptTouchEvents(true) if you need the item to receive touch events. It will be required in Qt 6.

831efa14e9 Update hovered on disabled QQuickItems
    QQuickItem::hovered will now update even when the item is disabled.

c1bcaca07f QJSEngine: Add a function to throw a pre-generated error object
    QJSEngine has gained an additional overload to the throwError() method, with the effect that calling throwError() with a character literal as argument is now ambiguous. You should explicitly construct a QString instead.

06d819cd71 QML: Warn about variables being used before their declaration
    QML warns about JavaScript variables being used before their declaration now. This is almost always a mistake. It is particularly dangerous in the presence of injected signal parameters because qmlcachegen cannot identify a name collision between an injected signal parameter and a variable being used before its declaration. It therefore miscompiles such code. You can turn off the deprecation warning using the "qt.qml.compiler" logging category.

b7412dc866 QML: Warn about usage of injected signal parameters
    The automatic injection of signal parameters into signal handlers is deprecated. This is because we cannot determine the names of the signal parameters at compile time. Furthermore, also for human readers it is difficult to discern between arguments, context properties, properties of the current object, and properties of the root object of the component. Requiring the signal parameters to be explicitly named resolves some of this confusion. You can turn the deprecation warning off using the "qt.qml.compiler" and "qt.qml.context" logging categories.


[qtwayland]
38fc568b Fix leaked subsurface wayland items
    Fixed a memory leak when creating subsurfaces.

bd1713ef Fix memory leak in QWaylandGLContext
    Fixed a memory leak when creating QOpenGLContexts on Wayland and using the wayland-egl backend.

3aa1b351 Fix race condition when attaching client to text input
    Fixed a problem where a virtual keyboard would not be updated correctly if two clients were started at almost the same time.


[qt3d]
c6aec09f4 Introduce QGeometryRenderer::sortIndex
    Add sortIndex property to QGeometryRenderer to explicitly control the order in which entities are rendered

86eb86514 Fix feature names in cmake
    Configuration time command line arguments have changed to use dashes rather than underscores


[qtimageformats]
d1819db Fix linking of WebP through CMake API
    Fixed an error that might have led to not compiling webp plugin when configuring Qt yourself.

2932b4c Update bundled libwebp to version 1.2.0
    Update bundled libwebp to version 1.2.0

16601c1 Update bundled libtiff to version 4.2.0
    Bundled libtiff was updated to version 4.2.0


[qtquickcontrols2]
4a718113a Allow style to be set to "Default" for compatibility
    Setting the style to "Default" now behaves the same way as not specifying a style; a relevant style will be chosen based on the platform. To use the style previously known as "Default", use "Basic".

df33c79fb Reset the opacity and scale properties after the exit transition
    After the exit transition is finished, then the opacity and scale properties will be reset to their values before the enter transition is started.


[qtcharts]
227020b1 Remove charts namespace for Qt6
    Use QT_NAMESPACE as other modules.


[qtvirtualkeyboard]
dfb10af Move qtvirtualkeyboard over to the new configure system
    The build system was switched to the new configure system. See documentation for updated instructions.

90d64de Fix activation of input panel when initial active focus is set
    It is now possible to open the input panel implicitly when activating the window. Before, this failed because the "visible" state was reset (due to a bug) during activation.

6ce4fc1 Sort language list by active languages
    The language list can now be sorted in any order by specifying the order in the active language list.

6421dbd Add new setting for user data path
    Added new property to settings VirtualKeyboardSettings.userDataPath. This allows the application or middleware to change the path to user files at runtime. Added also a signal to indicate user data reset - when the application triggers the signal, the virtual keyboard closes all files in the user's directory.

5b81a28 Add new setting for handwriting timeout
    Add new settings VirtualKeyboardSettings.hwrTimeoutForAlphabetic and VirtualKeyboardSettings.hwrTimeoutForCjk to allow the application to adjust the handwriting recognition timeout.

e923b4f Add new setting for input method hints
    Add new setting VirtualKeyboardSettings.inputMethodHints, which allows the application to set persistent application wide input method hints.

1477134 Add new setting for disabling handwriting mode
    Add new setting VirtualKeyboardSettings.disableHandwritingMode, which allows to disable handwriting mode at runtime.

c82d462 Add new settings defaultInputMethodDisabled, defaultDictionaryDisabled
    Add new settings VirtualKeyboardSettings.defaultInputMethodDisabled and VirtualKeyboardSettings.defaultDictionaryDisabled.

6e83e31 Add new method clearInputMode() to input method v2
    Added new method clearInputMode() to input method.

87d6c20 Add generic dictionary API for the virtual keyboard v2
    Added a generic dictionary API. The API allows applications to create/update/remove dictionaries at runtime. The desired dictionaries can be activated from the application. The implementation of the dictionaries depends on the input method. A typical use case for this API would be a phone book.

3a703e5 Add new function Trace.startHideTimer
    Added new function Trace.startHideTimer(), which allows the input method to hide trace before destroying the trace object.

32c025d Add new key type FlickKey v2
    Added a new key type FlickKey.

d22313c Add Stroke and Romaji values to the InputMode enumeration
    Added Stroke and Romaji values to the InputMode enumeration.

d3dbc82 CMake: Fix pinyin and tcime resource bundling
    Added vkb- prefix to no-bundle-pinyin no-bundle-tcime command line options (e.g. vkb-no-bundle-pinyin) and restored them as part of configuration.


[qtscxml]
96a69e7 Only return uniquely named services from invokedServices()
    If you have multiple equally named children of an invoked service, only one of them will be included in the "children" property now. Before, the fact that QVariantMap was actually a multimap was used to squeeze all of them in.

cfb46e8 Name and mark the scxml datamodel plugin headers as private
    The QScxmlEcmaScriptDataModel class is no longer part of the public API. This relates to moving the ecmascript datamodel's QML dependency from build time to runtime.


[qtquick3d]
c460e497 balsam: Return error codes
    balsam now returns an error code if no source was given, or the conversion failed.


[qtshadertools]
bbfcb67 Augment attributions for SPIRV-Cross
    Changed identified license of SPIRV-Cross to Apache License 2.0 and Khronos License, and fixed copyright attributions.

4e1806a Augment attributions for glslang
    Changed identified licenses in glslang to BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License, and Khronos License, and Apache License 2.0, and GNU General Public License v3.0 or later with Bison exception 2.2, and NVIDIA 2002 License. Augment Copyright information with details from file headers.


[qt5compat]
94966f0 Move graphical effects to qt5compat
    Added version of Qt Graphical Effects for compatibility with Qt 5 code. This can be accessed by importing "Qt5Compat.GraphicalEffects"
