Important Changes  
-----------------  
  
### Security fixes  
* CVE-2023-38197 in qtbase  
* CVE-2023-43114 in qtbase  
* CVE-2023-32763 in qtbase  
* CVE-2023-37369 in qtbase  
* CVE-2023-34410 in qtbase  
* CVE-2023-33285 in qtbase  
* CVE-2023-32762 in qtbase  
  
### qtbase  
* 9773f0175c Return qt-configure-module to bin/  
Upon further consideration, qt-configure-module was deemed user-facing,  
and was thus moved back to ./bin on all platforms.  
  
* 05e72d53a6 PCRE2: upgrade to 10.42  
PCRE2 has been updated to 10.42.  
  
* ca64365e3a Don't hide object replacement char except in rich text  
The object replacement character (U+FFFC) is now only filtered out in  
rich text controls, where they represent inline objects. In other  
controls, its glyphs will be shown as with other text.  
  
* 8892819d0c windows: Fix vertical metrics with GDI engine  
Fixed an issue where the line gap of some fonts would be included twice  
in the font's leading.  
  
* 0657b0734e Add QCryptographicHash::supportsAlgorithm() to check  
supported algorithm  
Add supportsAlgorithm() method that can be used to query OpenSSL and  
check whether the selected algorithm is supported.  
  
* 8602a224b6 QT_INLINE_SINCE: never inline for static Qt builds  
Restored binary compatibility for static Qt builds broken by the  
QT_INLINE_SINCE mechanism. Qt still does not guarantee BC for static  
build configurations otherwise.  
  
* 8f2d5a5649 CMake: Enforce QT_RESOURCE_ALIAS for absolute paths in  
resources  
In Qt resources, files that are specified as absolute paths must have  
the property QT_RESOURCE_ALIAS set.  
  
* eac9f39517 SQLite: Update SQLite to v3.40.0  
Updated SQLite to v3.40.0  
  
* 26c190f57e QTest::WatchDog: fix missing timeout resets on test  
function change  
Fixed a bug which caused QTEST_FUNCTION_TIMEOUT to be applied to the  
whole test execution, as opposed to each test function.  
  
* 02f1e72d5a Android: Set EnterKeyNext as default type for QLineEdit  
EnterKey type is now changed from EnterKeyDefault to EnterKeyNext for  
virtual keyboard in QLineEdit. It is done only if the focus can be moved  
to widget below.  
  
* 936cae6b53 Add QFileInfo::readSymLink() to read the raw link path  
Added readSymLink() to read the symlink's raw target, without resolving  
to an absolute path.  
  
* b82c9d08f8 QFileInfo: overload file time related methods to take a  
QTimeZone arg  
Overload file time related methods to take QTimeZone argument; mainly  
useful if all you need is UTC time, e.g. to compare file timestamps,  
this is inherently faster as no conversions need to be performed.  
  
* f68a2316d8 Long live QPromise::addResults()!  
Added addResults() to report multiple results at once.  
  
* 2b2065bf35 Slow Deprecation of FILENAME_VARIABLE, replacement by  
OUTPUT_SCRIPT  
The FILENAME_VARIABLE option of qt_generate_deploy_script and  
qt_generate_deploy_app_script is now deprecated, use OUTPUT_SCRIPT  
option instead.  
  
* cac325fdc1 SQLite: Update SQLite to v3.40.1  
Updated SQLite to v3.40.1  
  
* fe7a0c19a6 QFileSystemModel: add lastModified() overload that takes a  
QTimeZone  
Added lastModified() overload that takes a QTimeZone, this is useful  
when e.g. comparing file timestamps and all that's needed is time in UTC  
(this is faster as no time zone conversions is required). QTimeZone::UTC  
is used internally when sorting by time (using the sort() function),  
which should ideally make it faster too.  
  
* f6b026eed1 Move QTypeInfo<std::pair> from qpair.h to qtypeinfo.h to  
avoid ODR violation  
The QTypeInfo for std::pair/QPair will now be correct even if qpair.h  
hasn't been included, fixing an One-Definition-Rule (ODR) violation.  
  
* 595360506d QSqlRecord: add missing C++11 move SMFs  
Added move constructor, -assignment operator, and swap().  
  
* 19ca03c21c QUnicodeTools: Use thread-safe libthai API  
Correct line wrapping of Thai text now requires libthai version 0.1.25  
or above.  
  
* 03ed57afa0 Move QApplication::autoSipEnabled() to public scope  
bool QApplication::autoSipEnabled() is no longer a slot. Code such as  
using QObject::connect() to connect to it as a slot or accessing it  
through meta object system will have to be rewritten.  
  
* 2d1fd400fc Object to creating duplicate entries in a test-data table  
Duplicate data tags are now warned about. Every call to QTest::newRow()  
or QTest::addRow() should result in a distinct data tag. If they do not,  
a warning is produced. Likewise, duplicate column names are forbidden;  
each call to QTest::addColumn() should use a distinct name.  
  
* 5e76a9569e xkbcommon: make shortcuts persistent across layouts  
make keys produce the same shortcuts independently of current layout  
  
* d4f72b4de6 QStandardPaths/unix: ignore relative paths in all $XDG_*  
env vars  
Improved conformance to the Freedesktop basedir spec by ignoring any  
relative paths in XDG_* environment variables.  
  
* 40dd38813c QMimeDatabase: don't stat() something that isn't a local  
file  
Fixed a regression from 6.4.0 that made certain QMimeDatabase functions  
that inspected file contents to fail on Unix systems, if the file was  
not a native file (e.g., a Qt resource).  
  
* 7cbdc8abbd QVarLengthArray: add STL-style assign()  
Added assign().  
  
* 26fec96a81 QString, QByteArray: don't detach in  
removeIf/erase/eraseif()  
Removing characters from a currently shared string or byte array is now  
done more efficiently  
  
* cc6324665e QString: don't detach in insert()  
Calling insert() on a currently shared string is now done more  
efficiently.  
  
* 3a3b76e040 QString: don't detach in insert(qsizetype, QUtf8StringView)  
Inserting Utf8 data (e.g. a QUtf8StringView) into a currently shared  
QString is now done more efficiently.  
  
* eb60e94020 QString: don't detach in replace_helper()  
Using replace() on a currently shared QString is now done more  
efficiently  
  
* fc33fea999 Don't do font merging for PUA characters  
Font merging (automatic assignment of alternative fonts) is no longer  
applied for characters in the Private Use Areas of Unicode.  
  
* 224930726b Long live QScopedPropertyUpdateGroup  
New RAII class wrapping Qt::beginPropertyUpdateGroup() and  
Qt::endPropertyUpdateGroup().  
  
* b73574c4a6 SQL/MySQL: add options to explicitly specify the protocol  
type  
Added the ability to specify the MySQL/MariaDB connection type using  
the "MYSQL_OPT_PROTOCOL" connection string option. In case the  
connection type is "MEMORY" for shared memory, applications can specify  
the shared memory segment name using the "MYSQL_SHARED_MEMORY_BASE_NAME"  
option.  
  
* fbfee2d7c5 QVarLengthArray: clear() is not resize(0)  
clear() no longer requires the value_type to be default-constructible.  
  
* 94efcf9be4 Update bundled libjpeg-turbo to version 2.1.5  
libjpeg-turbo was updated to version 2.1.5  
  
* 0b4286ff28 Windeployqt: add custom qml output directory command line  
option  
Windeployqt's default behavior is now to deploy qml imports to a "qml"  
directory inside the deploy directory, rather than directly to the  
deploy directory.  
  
* fd70555b33 Deprecate usage of qt_ntfs_permission_lookup  
Deprecated the variable qt_ntfs_permission_lookup to avoid race  
conditions while enabling or disabling permission checks. It can be  
replaced by the RAII class QNtfsPermissionCheckGuard or with the  
functions qEnableNtfsPermissionChecks(), qDisableNtfsPermissionChecks()  
and qAreNtfsPermissionChecksEnabled().  
  
* 6d17697913 QFileSystemWatcher/Win: remove the pre-QFileInfo path  
normalization  
Fixed a bug that prevented removePaths() from removing the root of a  
drive on Windows.  
  
* c889ffed9f QTextStream: make dtor non-virtual come Qt 7  
Inheriting QTextStream is deprecated. QTextStream will no longer have a  
virtual destructor in QtÂ 7. If your code inherits QTextStream, port to a  
design that doesn't require a polymorphic QTextStream. You may define  
the macro QT_NO_INHERITABLE_TEXT_STREAM to mark QTextStream as final to  
assist you in checking for such code. This is the default if you're  
compiling with QT_DISABLE_DEPRECATED_UP_TO set to Qt 6.9.  
  
* 610bafdfc5 qxkbcommon: Treat XKB_KEY_{Super,Hyper}_{L,R} as  
Qt::Key_Meta by default  
Super ("Win" key) and Hyper keys will no longer produce the  
corresponding Qt::Key_Super or Qt::Key_Hyper key events, but will  
instead be mapped to Qt::Key_Meta and result in Qt::MetaModifier being  
set.  
  
* 0efd8854c4 A QtSql driver for Mimer SQL  
Added a QtSql plugin to work with the Mimer SQL database  
  
* bb2ff8a69f qdoc: Add *.webp as an default image suffix  
*.webp has been added to the list of default image suffixes.  
  
* 0fe6f818d2 Text: fix Soft hyphen rendering in QTextLayout::glyphRuns()  
Fixed an issue where spaces would sometimes be shown in soft hyphen  
positions in a string.  
  
* 05f913d57d qstrncpy: NUL-terminate even when src is nullptr  
Now NUL-terminates the target buffer even when the source pointer is  
nullptr, provided the target buffer has space for at least one byte.  
  
* 4183768d9b CMake: Fix position independent code linker flags not being  
set  
Qt tools are now built with position independent code even with Unix  
toolchains where this is not the default, for example clang.  
  
* 2a2fc4d16d QMessageAuthenticationCode: remove lazy initialization of  
messageHash  
No longer delays processing of the key to the first setData() or  
result() call. While passing a default-constructed key to the  
constructor and then calling setKey() continues to work, for optimal  
performance, we suggest to pass the actual key as a constructor argument  
and call setKey() only to change the key.  
  
* 738c48244b Android: use FileProvider with QDesktopServices::openUrl()  
Add AndroidX dependency to Gradle builds by default since it's required  
by FileProvider.  
  
* 863eb576c8 Remove qmake files that provide support for building Qt  
modules  
Support for building Qt modules with qmake was removed.  
  
* 8f33a0424f SQLite: Update SQLite to v3.41.0  
Updated SQLite to v3.41.0  
  
* 6990f23813 Long live QMessageAuthenticationCode::resultView()!  
Added QCryptographicHash-style resultView().  
  
* f5358e5932 a11y: Add new relations DescriptionFor, Described,  
Flows{From,To}  
Added new relation flags DescriptionFor, Described, FlowsFrom and  
FlowsTo.  
  
* 4b197c3f52 QRegularExpression: add support for non-filepath  
wildcards/globbing  
Support for non-filepath wildcards has been added to  
wildcardToRegularExpression().  
  
* 4ec5c0efc7 SQL/ODBC: Return all native error codes  
QSqlError::errorCode() might return a semicolon separated list of  
native error codes.  
  
* f2fc2013de QErrorMessage: Reset 'again' check box between each error  
message  
QErrorMessage will now reset the check box for showing a message again  
for each new message shown, as each individual message has its own  
suppression state.  
  
* 7261a22987 QAbstractItemModel: fix match() with Qt::MatchWildcard  
QAbstractItemModel::match() now uses more generic wildcard matches  
rather than file path globbing. Please refer to the documentation of  
QRegularExpression::wildcardToRegularExpression() for more information  
about the differences.  
  
* f030037d24 Implement qstrncpy() in terms of std::strncat()  
On non-Windows platforms, no longer writes to all bytes of the target  
buffer, but stops after the terminating NUL. This was already the  
behavior on Windows.  
  
* 30de1f74de SQL/MySQL: Add support for Bit-Value Type - BIT  
Added handling for Bit-Value Type - BIT.  
  
* 0d29a406f7 QThread: add sleep(std::chrono::nanoseconds) overload  
Added sleep(std::chrono::nanoseconds) overload.  
  
* 5bffb47d6e QFSFileEngine: fix overflow bug when using lseek64  
Fixed a bug where opening a file in append mode may fail if the file  
size was bigger than INT_MAX.  
  
* e7b8b7bfbe CMake: Add NO_COMPILER_RUNTIME to deploy script macros  
Added the option NO_COMPILER_RUNTIME to qt_generate_deploy_app_script.  
  
* c5d4dde678 QMessageAuthenticationCode: add move SMFs and swap()  
Added move constructor, move assignment operator and swap() function.  
  
* c19f9716fb QMessageAuthenticationCode: port to QByteArrayView [3/3]:  
static hash()  
The constructor, setKey(), addData() methods as well as the static  
hash() function take arguments by QByteArrayView instead of QByteArray  
now.  
  
* 82b75570f0 QProcess/Linux: fix file descriptor leak in case of failed  
child start  
Fixed a file descriptor leak in QProcess when running on Linux 5.4 or  
later, if the executable being run failed to start (for example, the  
file for the executable didn't exist).  
  
* 17e4b2d8ed SQLite: Update SQLite to v3.41.1  
Updated SQLite to v3.41.1  
  
* 092563a3d0 Skip QTimeZone::isTimeZoneIdAvailable()'s validity check on  
Unix  
On Unix (other than macOS and Android), the TZ-DB backend has long  
accepted any well-formed POSIX zone description as a time-zone ID. This  
is now reflected in QTimeZone::isTimeZoneIdAvailable(), which previously  
claimed not to accept these IDs. However, avaliableTimeZoneIds() still  
does not attempt to construct all possible POSIX descriptors to include  
in its return.  
  
* 617165af6b QProcess: reimplement systemEnvironment() using  
QProcessEnvironment  
Fixed a bug that would cause systemEnvironment() to produce corrupted  
entries (mojibake) on Windows if the environment contains characters  
outside of the ANSI character set.  
  
* 3f40a8b5b1 Add QTextListFormat::start: html and markdown ordered list  
index offset  
QTextList now supports specifying a start index using the new  
QTextList::{setStart, start} functions. The HTML start attribute on  
ordered lists in rich text documents is now parsed and used when  
rendering a text list. Non-negative indices in markdown lists are now  
also parsed and written properly. This allows starting a list with a  
different number than 1.  
  
* eb9c8042cf Short live QT_ENABLE_P0846_SEMANTICS_FOR!  
Fixed manual get<I>() calls (Tuple Protocol) in C++17 mode.  
  
* a1889b2a67 Verify fix for manual get<I> calls for QVector<N>D  
Fixed manual get<I>() calls (Tuple Protocol) in C++17 mode.  
  
* 4d90c4e74a QTimer: fix new-style slot invocation for receiver in  
another thread  
Fixed a bug that caused slots connected to single-slot timers using the  
new-style connection mechanism to be delivered in the wrong thread.  
  
* a9e8034e8c Implement [variant.get] for QVariant [2/2]: get()  
Implemented the type-based std::variant access protocol  
(get<T>()/get_if<T>()) to allow easier access to the contained element  
than the previous solution of casting data(), as well as to allow  
generic code to treat QVariant and std::variant the same. The  
holds_alternative<T>() function is not provided, since it's the same as  
get_if<T> != nullptr. The index-based variant access functions  
(get<I>()/get_if<I>()) are also not provided, because, unlike  
std::variant, QVariant does not have a bounded number of alternative  
types, and QMetaType IDs are not (all) compile-time constants.  
  
* 5a182d35e2 Update license specification for PCRE2  
Clarifying license of PCRE2 to be BSD-3-Clause with advertisement  
exception for binary-like packages.  
  
* f8dba0395f QPromise: add support for addResult(braced-initializer)  
Added support for calls to addResult() with braced initializers.  
  
* 9a39b3c796 Apply ScaleFactorRoundingPolicy to QT_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTORS  
The high-DPI scale factor rounding policy (settable with  
QGuiApplication::setHighDpiScaleFactorRoundingPolicy() or  
QT_SCALE_FACTOR_ROUNDING_POLICY) now applies to scale factors set with  
QT_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTORS.  
  
* c4debab927 Introduce QTP0002 policy for android-specific target  
properties  
Target properties that specify android-specific paths now support  
generator expressions, but these generator expressions must be evaluated  
to valid JSON strings. The behavior is controlled by the policy QTP0002.  
The OLD policy behavior is deprecated and the NEW behavior is preferred  
for use.  
  
* b46a914bd7 SQLite: Update SQLite to v3.41.2  
Updated SQLite to v3.41.2  
  
* 2f709952cf QSqlError: also compare nativeErrorCode() in operator==() /  
operator!=()  
The comparison operators have been fixed to take both error type and  
error code into account.  
  
* c080d1e64d Create any callable using QRunnable::create  
QRunnable::create can now take non-copyable functions as argument.  
  
* 87103e04e9 QMultiHash: fix missing update to m_size  
to not be counted, resulting in a hash map with an incorrect element  
count and which could cause an assertion failure depending on how the  
hash was later mutated.  
  
* 2f226336a2 QPluginLoader: don't instantiante multiple, identical  
instances  
staticInstances() will not call duplicated registrations of the same  
instantiation function, which can only happen as a result of duplicated  
Q_IMPORT_PLUGIN for the same plugin name.  
  
* 7f38f9f394 Long live QtFuture::makeReadyRangeFuture()  
Introduce QtFuture::makeReadyRangeFuture(). This method takes a  
container which has input iterators and returns a multi-value  
QFuture<ValueType>, where ValueType is the underlying type of the input  
container.  
  
* 9b4b32ec98 Long live QtFuture::makeReadyVoidFuture() and  
QtFuture::makeReadyValueFuture()  
Added QtFuture::makeReadyVoidFuture() and  
QtFuture::makeReadyValueFuture().  
  
* 028c367f75 Deprecate QtFuture::makeReadyFuture()  
The QtFuture::makeReadyFuture() method and all its specializations are  
deprecated since Qt 6.10. The reason for the deprecation is that the  
method has a makeReadyFuture(const QList<T> &) overload, which behaves  
differently from all other overloads (including other non-const ref  
QList overloads). Use QtFuture::makeReadyVoidFuture() when you need a  
ready void QFuture, or QtFuture::makeReadyValueFuture() when you need to  
propagate the input type to the returned QFuture, or  
QtFuture::makeReadyRangeFuture() when you need to create a multi-value  
future based on an input container.  
  
* 39fab09aad SQL/MySQL: add option MYSQL_OPT_TLS_VERSION &  
MYSQL_OPT_SSL_MODE  
Added the two new connect options MYSQL_OPT_TLS_VERSION and  
MYSQL_OPT_SSL_MODE.  
  
* 3983babd71 QSqlQuery: add boundValueName()/boundValueNames()  
Added two new functions boundValueName()/boundValueNames() to return  
the names of the bound values.  
  
* 2f95cd8f8b Long live QPromise::emplaceResult/At()!  
Added emplaceResult() and emplaceResultAt() member functions.  
  
* db346e711c Fix accessibility on XCB when running as root  
On XCB applications running as root are now accessible.  
  
* 24fe86ebe7 CMake: Store unsanitized plugin type names in module .json  
files  
The module information JSON files now contain the unsanitized plugin  
types of a module, e.g. wayland-decoration-client instead of  
wayland_decoration_client. Consumers of the module information file must  
sanitize plugin types themselves if necessary.  
  
* 25530c7020 win: Fix default fallback font for some languages  
Fixed an issue querying a default font for certain languages not  
supported by the primary system font.  
  
* 3d0fb2cea9 Windeployqt: Add a check for LLVM-MinGW runtimes  
Windeployqt now supports LLVM-MingGW runtimes.  
  
* 87535e4e43 QTimer: optimize single shot timers that cross thread  
Single-shot timers with a string-based connection are now started in  
the receiver's thread, not in the thread that creates the timer.  
  
* e1818d9e9c QXmlStreamAttributes: port value()/hasAttribute() to  
QAnyStringView  
Ported value() and hasAttribute() to QAnyStringView.  
  
* 55a51e1909 Implement QXmlStreamReader::hasStandaloneDeclaration()  
added hasStandaloneDeclaration()  
  
* 5dabac2c9c Change QTimeZone's offset range into constants, not an enum  
The MinUtcOffsetSecs and MaxUtcOffsetSecs constants are now static  
constexpr members of QTimeZone, rather than members of an anonymous  
enum. Their values are now 16 hours either side of zero, to allow for  
some historical zones.  
  
* 968250ee14 QMetaProperty: add write() overload taking rvalue QVariant  
Added write() overload taking an rvalue QVariant.  
  
* 5f28d367d9 Make QPointer<T> constructible from QPointer<X>  
QPointer<T> can now be (move- and copy-)constructed from QPointer<X>.  
  
* 959800f6de Short live Q_NODISCARD_CTOR  
attribute for constructors on compilers that support it, and does  
nothing on other compilers.  
  
* 29b2506e8c Allow disable native messagebox dialog  
Added options functionality to QMessagebox. The currently only option  
available is DontUseNativeDialog.  
  
* b6d04c8a82 QMetaProperty: add writeOnGadget() overload taking rvalue  
QVariant  
Added writeOnGadget() overload taking an rvalue QVariant.  
  
* 0e7e1c3396 Take move-only functions for the threadpool  
Methods taking callable functions, can now take move-only lambdas.  
  
* 275e0e48a9 Deprecate Q_ASSUME  
The Q_ASSUME macro is now deprecated. Do not use it in new code and  
consider removing it from existing code.  
  
* 2162e0dfc4 Schannel: Add support for import of PKCS12/PFX files  
Add support for PKCS12 import with Schannel backend.  
  
* 3bf5b5f894 Use QSlotObject helpers in functor-cases of  
QMetaObject::invoke  
Using a functor with several operator() overloads in  
QMetaObject::invokeMethod now causes a compile time error. Qt would  
previously ignore const and noexcept overloads and always call the  
mutable version on a copy of the functor.  
  
* 1373a20f99 QTestEventLoop: don't stop the test fails outside the main  
thread  
The QTestEventLoop no longer attempts to exit its event loop if the  
failure was detected outside the main thread.  
  
* a2551c45d4 Move the formatting of <chrono> durations to QDebug &  
QtTest  
Added pretty formatting of C++ <chrono> durations.  
  
* 6160ea45b6 Implement API for enabling / disabling OpenType features  
Added an API to QFont which makes it possible to enable and disable  
specific typographic features in OpenType fonts.  
  
* 8c0153a526 Fix QMenu (+other theme) sizes on Windows multiscreen  
systems  
Fixed menu sizes on Windows systems with more screens.  
  
* 0306247f5a Remove Java iterator APIs for moving back if operator-- is  
not available  
QSetIterator no longer has a hasPrevious() member function. The  
underlying iterator doesn't implement operator--(), so couldn't be moved  
backwards anyway.  
  
* ec0e0d1e81 QDeadlineTimer: make it so any negative millisecond count  
is "forever"  
QDeadlineTimer will now interpret negative millisecond remaining times  
as "forever", instead of only the value -1. This brings the API closer  
in line with other API like QMutex. This change does not apply to the  
nanosecond counts in the API, nor to the API based on std::chrono.  
  
* 305f61a807 Remove the -sysroot option from configure  
The -sysroot option was removed. Use CMAKE_SYSROOT or  
CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE instead.  
  
* 7dba2c8761 QDnsLookup/Unix: make sure we don't overflow the buffer  
Fixed a bug that could cause a buffer overflow in Unix systems while  
parsing corrupt, malicious, or truncated replies.  
  
* 29b2fe40dc Revert commit "don't ever force fork() instead of forkfd()"  
Reverted a change from Qt 6.0 that made the childProcessModifier()  
callback be run in a child created by means other than a real fork()  
library call, a situation in which certain other library functions would  
be unusable, unreliable, or cause deadlocks. A flag to opt in to the  
solution with better performance will be added to Qt 6.6.  
  
* 9a73bc5f3d QDnsLookup/Windows: use DnsQueryEx so IPv6 servers are  
supported  
setNameserver() now supports IPv6 servers with on Apple systems, AIX,  
FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, and Windows.  
  
* 48b6c8503a QProcess/Unix: enable setChildProcessModifier for  
startDetached  
The modifier function set with setChildProcessModifier() will now also  
be executed when the process is started with startDetached().  
  
* bbbe5f45c4 QList: add STL-style assign()  
Added assign().  
  
* 365af87f94 QDnsLookup/Windows: don't append domain search suffixes  
QDnsLookup on Windows will no longer append the system's configured  
domain name for look ups that contained only a single label (that is, no  
dots). This matches the Unix behavior.  
  
* b40ab2f8a6 SQLite: Update SQLite to v3.42.0  
Updated SQLite to v3.42.0  
  
* 8566c2db85 QUuid: add support for 128-bit integers  
Added support for converting between QUuid and quint128, on platforms  
that offer 128-bit integer types (all 64-bit ones supported by Qt,  
except MSVC).  
  
* f9c87cfd44 QProcess/Unix: add setUnixProcessParameters()  
Added setUnixProcessParameters() function that can be used to modify  
certain settings of the child process, without the need to provide a  
callback using setChildProcessModifier().  
  
* bce7009f55 QDnsLookup: add support for setting the port number of the  
server  
Added setNameserverPort().  
  
* c7af8d5808 Deprecate qAsConst()  
qAsConst() is now deprecated. You can simply globally search and  
replace "qAsConst" with "std::as_const" in your code-base.  
  
* 07d6d31a4c QFuture: Gracefully handle a destroyed context in  
continuations  
Added support for context objects of continuations being destroyed  
before the continuation finishes. In these cases the future is cancelled  
immediately.  
  
* 39cdf431f0 QObject: add setProperty() overload taking rvalue QVariant  
Added setProperty() overload taking an rvalue QVariant.  
  
* 6f529c38ce QVariant::fromStdVariant(): protect against accidental  
fromValue() ADL pick-ups  
The fromStdVariant() function used an unqualifed fromValue() call to  
convert each alternative type in the std::variant. It now uses qualified  
QVariant::fromValue() to avoid picking up unrelated fromValue()  
overloads whose return value just happens to implicitly convert to  
QVariant.  
  
* 18a2c62c07 QByteArray: add STL-style assign()  
Added assign().  
  
* f564e905c1 QVariant: Support emplace  
Implemented in-place construction for QVariant. The constructor taking  
std::in_place_type<Type> constructs an object of type Type directly  
inside QVariant's storage, without any further copy or move operations.  
QVariant::emplace() does the same when replacing the content of an  
existing QVariant and tries to reuse previously-allocated memory.  
  
* 1d3ae5f0e9 cmake: Add known translations to CFBundleLocalizations in  
Info.plist  
Translations added via qt_add_translations are now reflected as  
CFBundleLocalizations entries in the application's Info.plist file on  
Apple platforms. to disable this behavior, set  
QT_NO_SET_PLIST_LOCALIZATIONS.  
  
* 1eb4d17cb4 Generate and set a CFBundleIdentifier when none were  
provided on macOS  
When using Ninja generator, if neither  
`XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` nor  
`MACOSX_BUNDLE_GUI_IDENTIFIER` is provided for a target, a bundle  
identifier, i.e., `com.yourcompany.<teamid>.<target>` will be generated  
and set as CFBundleIdentifier.  
  
* 79ae79d05c QVariant::fromValue: Add rvalue optimization  
Added fromValue() overload taking rvalues.  
  
* 8983225d3c QVariant: add rvalue overload of fromStdVariant()  
Added overload of fromStdVariant() taking rvalue std::variant<>s.  
  
* 8b6bd8ed99 QDnsLookup: allow looking up the root domain  
It is now possible to look up the root DNS domain, by setting the name  
property to an empty string. This query is usually done while setting  
the query type to NS.  
  
* ef1be84551 QStringDecoder: add a char16_t overload of  
appendToBuffer(QChar*, ~~~)  
Added appendToBuffer() overload for char16_t*, complementing the  
existing overload taking QChar*.  
  
* 54d8d8055e QString: add STL-style assign() [1/4]: non-(it,it)  
overloads  
Added assign().  
  
* e6fb3b4ea0 QPixmapCache: fix leaking of QStrings and Keys on clear()  
Fixed QString key data not being freed on clear().  
  
* 7a42679a98 Freetype: Don't do image transform for translations  
Fixed an issue where setting a translation matrix on text using a  
bitmap font would cause rendering artifacts.  
  
* 2948ab16ea QPixmapCache: deprecate replace()  
The `replace(key, pixmap)` function has been deprecated, because  
passing a `const Key` to it results in undefined behavior. Use  
`remove(key, pixmap)` followed by `key = insert(pixmap)` instead.  
  
* 56598b65fa Fix no-op emission of QComboBox::currentTextChanged  
emit currentTextChanged only, if currentText changes.  
  
* 211ff8ac53 QPixmapCache: Move qHash(Key) from _p.h to public header  
Made the qHash() overload for QPixmapCache::Key public (was: private)  
API.  
  
* f1adc51ca4 QFutureSynchronizer: fix aliasing problem in setFuture()  
Fixed a crash in setFuture() if the argument was already a member of  
QFutureSynchronizer::futures().  
  
* a9c29029d3 Consult QIcon::fallbackThemeName() even for themes with  
explicit parents  
QIcon::fallbackThemeName() will now be used as fallback even for themes  
that declare a parent theme.  
  
* c00d99d96e Consult QIcon::fallbackSearchPaths() even when theme name  
is empty  
QIcon::fallbackSearchPaths() will now be consulted for fallback icons  
even if the current theme name is empty.  
  
* abd60e9592 SSL: upgrade the default DH parameters  
The default Diffie-Hellman parameters are now using the 2048-bit MODP  
group from RFC 3526.  
  
* c131e159b0 Introduce QT_SYNC_HEADERS_AT_CONFIGURE_TIME flag  
When building Qt from sources, syncqt and Qt header files are now  
created at build time, not configure time. This should speed up the  
configuration step. You can set the CMake variable  
QT_CONFIGURE_TIME_SYNC_HEADERS to ON to use the previous behavior,  
though. The old behavior is also preserved if cmake/configure is run  
from inside an IDE - Qt Creator, Visual Studio Code, and CLion are  
currently detected.  
  
* f03c7e4a2d Introduce -no-vcpkg flag for disabling vcpkg  
detection/integration  
vcpkg detection, and integration can be disabled by passing the -no-  
vcpkg flag to the configure command, or by passing `-DQT_USE_VCPKG=OFF`  
to the cmake command.  
  
* 51dc94df9c QGtk3Theme: Do not default Active WindowText to button  
foreground  
Default to GTK Entry Text / Normal Text / qt_fusionPalette  
  
* d117cd5f3a QPixmapCache: ignore insertion or searches with empty key  
Trying to insert or find a pixmap with an empty key string now always  
fails immediately.  
  
* cb3416696f Update bundled libpng to version 1.6.40  
libpng was updated to version 1.6.40  
  
* 32f93394ef CMake: Don't use VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET for triplet  
deduction  
Qt no longer uses the VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET environment variable to  
deduce target triplet. By default we let vcpkg's toolchain file  
automatically deduce the triplet to use. The new QT_VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET  
environment variable can be used instead, or pass  
-DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=<triplet> to CMake.  
  
* 90d96766af QEventLoopLocker: defend against nullptr arguments  
Is now a no-op on nullptr QEventLoop*, QThread*,  
QCoreApplication::instance() (was: crash).  
  
* 3cc1885370 QEventLoopLocker: inline Private into public class  
No longer allocates; all operations are noexcept now.  
  
* a83d59b901 QLibrary: make isLoaded() report whether this object has  
load()ed  
QLibrary::isLoaded() now reports whether this instance of QLibrary has  
succeeded in loading the library, via direct or indirect call to load().  
Previously, it used to reported whether the actual library was loaded by  
any QLibrary instance.  
  
* e46c3c3e5a QCborValue: fix memleak on Array to Map coercion  
Fixed a memory leak when an array was coerced into a map.  
  
* 41388a7ce4 QSslDiffieHellmanParameters: fix mem-leak  
Fixed a memory leak in parsing of PEM-encoded Diffie-Hellman  
parameters.  
  
* aa2c0eb7eb CMake: Unify CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE behavior on all platforms  
When no explicit build type is specified, Windows will now default to  
building Release like the other platforms.  
  
* 7b6682cfbb QIcon::fromTheme(): Always consult "hicolor" theme last  
The 'hicolor' theme will now always be prioritized last when looking up  
fallback themes, even if explicitly declared as a theme parent in a  
theme.  
  
* 99d0f997aa iOS: Implement QPlatformWindow::setMask() for masking  
rendering and input  
QWindow::setMask() is now supported for masking the rendering and touch  
input of child windows.  
  
* 8d0833a81b Update bundled libjpeg-turbo to version 3.0.0  
libjpeg-turbo was updated to version 3.0.0  
  
* f974ea6f86 QDeadlineTimer: make the (Qt::TimerType) ctor explicit  
The QDeadlineTimer(Qt::TimerType) constructor is no longer implicit. To  
keep old source working, wrap the Qt::TimerType argument in  
QDeadlineTimer{}. This is backwards-compatible with older Qt versions.  
  
* 6f00da8489 SQL: add missing Q_DECLARE_SHARED to the value types  
QSqlField and QSqlRecord are now relocatable types.  
  
* cbea2f5705 QSqlIndex: implement member swap() and use a macro for  
move-assignment  
QSqlIndex is now a relocatable type.  
  
* bcbbafca88 QGuiApplication: Report default platform name before  
initialization  
QGuiApplication::platformName now reports the default platform name if  
QGuiApplication hasn't been instantiated yet. It used to return an empty  
string.  
  
* 6ec1766c5c Android: use all nameFilters at once for native file dialog  
use all nameFilters at once since Android file picker can't change  
nameFilters after being opened.  
  
* 35dda81f7a SQLite: Update SQLite to v3.43.0  
Updated SQLite to v3.43.0  
  
* 35ee5b4eb7 Set color scheme after handling theme change in windows  
Update colorScheme property after palette change.  
  
* 62e17eae88 Update bundled zlib to version 1.3  
zlib was updated to version 1.3.  
  
* 43326b3802 CMake: Recompute features when dependent features are  
marked dirty  
The build system will now try to recompute configure features when  
dependent feature values are toggled by the user.  
  
* e8fb761f75 Fix qHash(qfloat16) to match Qt 6.4 behavior  
Fixed qHash(qfloat16) which was broken from 6.5.0 to 6.5.3, inclusive.  
If you compiled against one of the affected Qt versions, you need to  
recompile against either Qt 6.4 or earlier or 6.5.4 or later, because  
the problematic code is inline.  
  
* 4dc4bf6cf1 Document q(u)int128 and QT_SUPPORTS_INT128  
Added qint128 and quint128 typedefs on platforms that support them.  
  
* e8514f771d Long live Q_(U)INT128_C()!  
Added Q_INT128_C() and Q_UINT128_C() macros to create qint128 and  
quint128 literals in a platform-independent way.  
  
* a66a3983f2 Fix crash when reading corrupt font data  
Fixed a possible crash that could happen when loading corrupted font  
data.  
  
* f504186992 SQLite: Update SQLite to v3.43.1  
Updated SQLite to v3.43.1  
  
* 096a112259 [docs] Fix \since for qHash(qfloat16)  
Delete the old entry for qHash(qfloat16), keep the one from this  
commit.  
  
### qtsvg  
* d130c74 Don't rasterize gigantic shapes  
Unreasonably large shapes are now ignored in SVG files to avoid  
stalling the application. The check can be disabled by setting  
QT_SVG_DISABLE_SIZE_LIMIT=1 in the environment.  
  
* ff22c3c QSvgFont: Initialize used member, remove unused  
Fixed undefined behavior from using uninitialized variable.  
  
### qtdeclarative  
* 83bf594fbd Pointer handlers: don't emit canceled() when an extra  
button interrupts  
A Pointer Handler no longer emits the canceled() signal when it  
deactivates due to violating conditions (such as pressing the right  
button when acceptedButtons == LeftButton).  
  
* 4bad329985 Fix missing glyphs when using NativeRendering  
Fixed an issue where text using NativeRendering would sometimes be  
missing glyphs.  
  
* 46fb848411 QQuickTableView: change the order of row and column to  
modelIndex()  
Because of a source incompatible change in Qt 6.4.0 and Qt 6.4.1,  
modelIndex(column, row) has been reverted back to modelIndex(row,  
column), equal to how it was in Qt 6.3. This also affects modelIndex()  
in TableView. If the order used in Qt 6.4.1 is needed, you can set the  
environment variable QT_QUICK_TABLEVIEW_COMPAT_VERSION=6.4  
  
* 3df8eba0f5 qmltc: generate code into namespaces  
The type compiler will generate C++-code into a namespace by default.  
The  new default namespace is inferred from the module's URI, where dots  
are interpreted as separating subnamespaces from each other, e.g., a  
type in module MyCompany.MyModule.Sub will be generated in the namespace  
MyCompany::MyModule::Sub.  
  
* b5eecccec8 Slow Deprecation of FILENAME_VARIABLE, replacement by  
OUTPUT_SCRIPT  
The FILENAME_VARIABLE option of qt6_generate_deploy_qml_app_script is  
now deprecated, use OUTPUT_SCRIPT option instead.  
  
* 5c496ad952 AnimatedImage: Add ability to configure sourceSize  
It's now possible to configure sourceSize property for AnimatedImage.  
This might be useful when you need e.g. to play hi-res GIF files in some  
smaller size.  
  
* 2d44365f69 CMake: Allow omitting the version of QML modules  
You can now omit the VERSION argument to qt_add_qml_module(). This will  
automatically generate the highest possible version.  
  
* 2b6eb1a51d MultiPointTouchArea: rename signal arguments in Qt 7; test  
with formals  
As a reminder: you should always use formal parameters when writing a  
signal handler that depends on an argument, such as  
MultiPointTouchArea.onPressed, onUpdated, onReleased, or onCanceled. It  
gives you an opportunity to name the argument, to avoid confusion with  
the touchPoints property, and will avoid behavior changes if we rename  
the argument in a future version.  
  
* aea8c9e093 TableView: deprecate modelIndex(row, column) in favor of  
index(row, column)  
modelIndex(row, column) has been deprecated in favor of index(row,  
column).  
  
* 3343c57b02 TableView: deprecate itemAtCell(column, row) in favor of  
itemAtIndex(modelIndex)  
itemAtCell(column, row) has been deprecated in favor of  
itemAtIndex(modelIndex).  
  
* 3773ad8534 TableView: deprecate positionViewAtCell(column, row) in  
favor of positionViewAtIndex(modelIndex)  
positionViewAtCell(column, row) has been deprecated in favor of  
positionViewAtIndex(modelIndex).  
  
* 3cc1e62157 Unexport QSGMaterialShader::GraphicsPipelineState  
The GraphicsPipelineState struct in QSGMaterialShader is no longer  
exported. This may present a binary compatibility break in theory, but  
unlikely to affect any applications in practice given that there is no  
use case for creating or copying an instance of this type in user code.  
This struct serves solely as input to the virtual  
updateGraphicsPipelineState() function, and instances are always created  
and initialized with default values by Qt.  
  
* b9834e0ee9 QmlCompiler: Fix coercion of undefined to float and double  
Converting a JavaScript value to a double or float, for example by  
inserting it into a typed array, now assumes JavaScript type coercion  
semantics. In particular, converting a value that is not actually a  
number now results in NaN where it previously sometimes resulted in 0.  
  
* 4c930247e6 Set correct `this` value in JSON.stringify replacer scope  
Set correct `this` value in JSON.stringify replacer scope, so that the  
value for current key in current object is no longer pre-stringified,  
and can actually be used to implement custom object serialization logic.  
  
* fd7fe4450b QSGDefaultPainterNode: Set format to RGBA8888_Premultiplied  
Changed image format to RGBA8888_Premultiplied in order to improve  
texture upload performance on OpenGL ES and WebGL.  
  
* a60968283b QML: Fix conflicts between QML_ANONYMOUS, QML_UNCREATABLE  
and namespaces  
You can no longer override the "uncreatable" message for QML-exposed  
namespaces using QML_UNCREATABLE. This would be incompatible with making  
the QML_UNCREATABLE macro safe from unintended inheritance. The latter  
is much more important.  
  
* 0a0f777821 CMake: Add NO_COMPILER_RUNTIME to  
qt_generate_deploy_qml_app_script  
Added the option NO_COMPILER_RUNTIME to  
qt_generate_deploy_qml_app_script.  
  
* d66db6c802 QSGDefaultPainterNode: Skip fillRect for invalid fill color  
Background filling can now be disabled by setting the fill color to an  
invalid color. This may improve performance, and is safe to do if the  
paint() function draws to all pixels on each frame.  
  
* efc037191a XHR: Add responseURL  
Added missing responseURL property. This returns the url that was used  
to retrieve the response data, after any redirects have occurred.  
  
* 37c25c6e74 QQuickItemView: Skip instantiating delegates if size is 0  
If a ListView has size zero, it won't instantiate any delegates until  
its size becomes non-zero.  
  
* 66f167aedc XMLHttpRequest: Implement XHR.overrideMimeType()  
Added missing overrideMimeType(mime) method. This function can be used  
to force the XHR object to parse the data in HTTP responses differently  
than what the server suggests.  
  
* 017bf54020 Hook up GPU frame timing to QQuickGraphicsConfig and the  
logs  
The scenegraph render loop timing logs can now show GPU-side times as  
well, as long as the application is launched with the env.var.  
QSG_RHI_PROFILE=1 or the feature is enabled via the new APIs in  
QQuickGraphicsConfiguration.  
  
* adc3d8b2e4 Fix StackLayout to keep the current visible item after  
insert/removal  
StackLayout will now update currentIndex if an Item is inserted or  
removed at an index less than or equal to the current index.  
  
* d93ca833f6 Add startAngle and endAngle properties to Dial  
The start and end angle of the dial element are made customizabe.  
  
* fcf3f5655b Add wrapped signal to Dial  
The dial element emits the wrapped() signal when it is wrapped around.  
  
* 5da4d5e808 Material: fix clipped floating placeholder text  
The outlined TextArea now sets topInset by default if it or its  
Flickable parent clips. This avoids the floating placeholder being  
clipped in those cases. The outlined TextField sets topInset by default  
only if the TextField itself clips.  
  
* 41f36038fb Remove the 'qml-devtools' feature  
The 'qml-devtools' feature is removed. All tools that depend on this  
feature are mandatory and need to be build unconditionally.  
  
* ce85cb1616 Update displayText and value of SpinBox (live)  
The value of a SpinBox can be updated automatically (live) when the  
user edits the text. The displayText of a SpinBox is updated and  
sanitized automatically.  
  
* f940f1b87e TreeView: add support for setting a root index  
You can now set a rootIndex in TreeView, to only show a branch of the  
tree model.  
  
* bdb7bc0543 QQuickScrollView and QQuickTextEdit: Fix binding loops  
Added effectiveScrollBarWidth and effectiveScrollBarHeight which hold  
the effective sizes of scrollbars.  
  
* 995a584c10 Add font.features API to match the one in QFont  
Added font.features property for fine-grained customization of the  
shaping process.  
  
* 9982f16ead Add uniformCellWidths and uniformCellHeights to QuickLayout  
Added uniformCellSizes properties to QuickLayout  
  
* 517d0efb7b TableView: implement SelectionMode  
You can now set a selectionMode in TableView, to control if the user  
should be allowed to select single or multiple cells.  
  
* 90a5e8d217 Introduction of LayoutItemProxy  
Added LayoutItemProxy, a helper item for writing responsive layouts.  
  
* 2eee3f5b69 Make properties in Qt Quick Controls FINAL  
The resizing property is now FINAL, meaning that it can no longer be  
shadowed by user declared properties.  
  
* ecfefd8b97 Make some properties in the effects module FINAL  
Properties for the type MultiEffect are now FINAL, meaning they can no  
longer be shadowed by declaring new properties with the same names in  
QML. A warning will be printed out to the console, when a FINAL property  
is being shadowed. We recommend that users rename those properties to  
avoid potential unexpected behavior changes.  
  
* a32e1543dd Make some properties in Qt Quick Shapes FINAL  
Properties for types in the Qt Quick Shapes module are now FINAL,  
meaning they can no longer be shadowed by declaring new properties with  
the same names in QML. A warning will be printed out to the console,  
when a FINAL property is being shadowed. We recommend that users rename  
those properties to avoid potential unexpected behavior changes.  
  
* f8befff6dc Make properties in Qt Quick Layouts FINAL  
Properties for types in the Qt Quick Layouts module are now FINAL,  
meaning they can no longer be shadowed by declaring new properties with  
the same names in QML. A warning will be printed out to the console,  
when a FINAL property is being shadowed. We recommend that users rename  
those properties to avoid potential unexpected behavior changes.  
  
* 16d822ff32 Make properties in the particles module FINAL  
Properties for types in the Qt Quick Particles module are now FINAL,  
meaning they can no longer be shadowed by declaring new properties with  
the same names in QML. A warning will be printed out to the console,  
when a FINAL property is being shadowed. We recommend that users rename  
those properties to avoid potential unexpected behavior changes.  
  
* 702c36dfc6 Make properties in Qt Quick FINAL to prevent shadowing  
Most properties for types in the QtQuick module are now FINAL, meaning  
that they can no longer be shadowed by declaring new properties with the  
same names. With few exceptions. A warning will be printed out to the  
console, when a FINAL property is shadowed. We recommend that users  
rename those properties to avoid potential unexpected behavior changes.  
  
* 06540cdb02 Flickable: Proportional wheel scrolling if deceleration is  
large  
When using a plain "clicky" mouse wheel, Flickable has historically  
applied acceleration: the faster you rotate the wheel, the faster it  
flicked. The default value of flickDeceleration was 5000, which felt  
hard to control, but changing it in QML affected touch-flicking and  
wheel behavior simultaneously. So now we decouple those:  
flickDeceleration only affects touchscreen flicking, and Flickable  
rather uses a new default value of 15000, which is defined to mean that  
scroll distance becomes directly proportional to  
QWheelEvent::angleDelta() * QStyleHints::wheelScrollLines() (where a  
"line" is 24 logical pixels, because Flickable does not have direct  
understanding of its contents). You can set the new environment var  
QT_QUICK_FLICKABLE_WHEEL_DECELERATION to a value from 1 to 14999 to  
restore wheel acceleration behavior from older versions; 5000 was the  
old value.  
  
* 2af5cc0a7f QML models: Make most properties FINAL to prevent  
accidental shadowing  
Most properties for types in the QtQml.Models module are now FINAL,  
meaning that they can no longer be shadowed by declaring new properties  
with the same names. A warning will be printed out to the console, when  
a FINAL property is shadowed. We recommend that users rename those  
properties to avoid potential unexpected behavior changes.  
  
* 1f6b5f1d43 Fix memory leak when invalidating NativeRendering fonts  
Fixed a controlled memory leak with Text.NativeRendering where loading  
and unloading the same application fonts could cause memory usage to  
increase indefinitely and not be regained until the window was closed.  
  
* f1a084c5e5 qmlls: fix the order in which the build directory is  
obtained  
Qmlls warns when inexisting build folder paths are passed to the  
--build-dir argument or the QMLLS_BUILD_DIRS environment variable. Also,  
it will inform the user if the build directory was set using the command  
line option, the environment variable or an .qmlls.ini settings file, if  
existent in the source folder.  
  
* aa603e1544 qmlformat: fix formatting of object destructuring  
qmlformat will no longer add "" characters automatically in the object  
keys unless the object key is actually a string literal. Also, using a  
scoped variable as the property key will no longer result in the  
duplication of the property name.  
  
### qtmultimedia  
* 0220951e7 Fix behavior of QAudioSink::resume in push mode  
Calling QAudioSink::resume() now returns the sink to the state it had  
when QAudioSink::suspend() was called, no matter whether the sink  
operates in pull or push mode.  
  
* bea75b36c Use new permissions API on Android  
The platform implementation no longer requests Camera and Microphone  
permissions, only checks if they are granted or not. The client  
application must request the permissions using the QPermission API.  
  
* ed04adaf7 Use new permissions API on macOS/iOS  
The platform implementation no longer requests Camera and Microphone  
permissions, only checks if they are granted or not. The client  
application must request the permissions using the QPermission API.  
  
### qttools  
* 86f290ee7 QDoc: Require clangcpp as a dependency  
QDoc will now require "clangcpp" to be available.  
  
* da526cfbf Update qlitehtml module  
Litehtml (used in Qt Assistant) was updated to upstream version v0.6.  
  
* 07efdc53c QDoc: Drop support for renaming commands via qdocconf files  
Support for the 'alias' variable in qdocconf-files is removed. Use  
QDoc's 'macro' construct instead.  
  
* f1f4cad99 QDoc: Always depend on QmlPrivate  
QDoc now requires the library QmlPrivate. Make sure the qtdeclarative  
module is available.  
  
* d5007c7a5 lupdate: Handle C++ string literals  
lupdate now supports prefixed string literals like u"foo".  
  
* c4b0be181 QDoc: Don't write default attributes to index files  
QDoc no longer writes the attributes virtual, const, static, final, or  
override, to the index files, unless the attribute is part of a function  
or method's signature. This reduces the file size of index files  
somewhat.  
  
* 7057d01fb QDoc: Append hash to canonical titles with non-alnum  
characters  
QDoc now appends a hash of the original title to the fragment  
identifier generated for that title if the title contains non-ascii  
characters. This means QDoc now generates fragment identifiers for  
titles that are written in non-latin characters.  
  
* 52c8f1dbd QDoc: Append hash when normalizing non-ascii file names  
QDoc now appends a hash of the original file name to the file name(s)  
of files where the name contains non-ascii characters. This means QDoc  
now generates files for pages with names written in non-latin  
characters.  
  
* 85f0b6ff4 Qt Designer: Add QFont::HintingPreference to property editor  
Support for the QFont::HintingPreference property has been added.  
  
* cd0b646e0 QDoc: Add support for platform dependent EOL chars  
You can now configure QDoc to generate platform dependent end-of-line  
characters in the files it generates. Set the new configuration variable  
`platformEOL = true` to enable this behavior. This can be useful on  
Windows, where the EOL sequence is `\r\n`. QDoc retains `\n` as default  
EOL character sequence.  
  
* c5f973ca9 Qt Designer: Add QFont::Weight to the property editor  
QFont::Weight is now available in the property editor, introducing a  
new "fontweight" .ui attribute. To preserve compatibility, the values  
"Normal"/"Bold" will result in the old "bold" attribute being used.  
  
* 3d691abe7 lconvert: Add -pluralonly command line argument  
Added a -pluralonly command line argument to drop non-plural form  
messages.  
  
### qtdoc  
* 1b416bc8 Bump CMake requirements on Apple platforms  
The minimum CMake version for Qt on Apple platforms is now 3.21.1.  
  
### qtlocation  
* 4b81f1a3 Remove all C++ event handling, prep for pointer handlers  
Map is now non-interactive, concerned only with rendering.  
  
* eaab4630 Add MapView  
MapView is the interactive replacement for the Map item in earlier  
releases. It wraps a Map instance with pointer handlers to make it  
interactive.  
  
### qtpositioning  
* 75c6e4e1 Allow to specify a baud rate for NMEA plugin  
Provide an 'nmea.baudrate' parameter for the NMEA plugin. The parameter  
takes any positive integer value and uses it as a baudrate for a  
serialport connection. If the value is not specified, or an incorrect  
value is specified, a default value of 4800 is used.  
  
* 4d02ca5c Use new permissions API on Android  
The platform implementation no longer requests location permissions,  
only checks if they are granted or not. The client application must  
request the permissions using the QPermission API.  
  
* a7b347aa Use new permissions API on macOS/iOS  
The platform implementation no longer requests location permissions,  
only checks if they are granted or not. The client application must  
request the permissions using the QPermission API.  
  
### qtconnectivity  
* 1e903be8 QBluetoothUuid: remove quint128 support  
The undocumented quint128 was removed from QtBluetooth. This affects  
the QBluetoothUuid constructor and the toUInt128() method. QUuid has  
support for an integer quint128 on certain 64-bit platforms (all except  
MSVC) with a constructor and a getter of the same name, so this change  
is mostly source-compatible, so long as the application code doesn't  
attempt to treat this type as a structure. For cross-platform support,  
use QUuid::Id128Bytes.  
  
* d195ae3a SDP scanner: encode input URLs and escape XML-specific  
characters  
sdpscanner now %-encodes the URLs and escapes all XML-specific  
characters in them before adding the result to the generated XML output.  
  
* ae1a1f5e QtBluetooth: port the code to the new permissions API  
(CoreBluetooth)  
Do not request permissions implicitly, only check them and leave it to  
applications to request permissions explicitly.  
  
* 55abcc47 QBluetoothUuid - add platform-specific conversion functions  
Add CoreBluetooth-specific conversion to QBluetoothUuid class, to get  
CBUUID out of QBluetoothUuid and convert CBUUID to QBluetoothUuid.  
  
* f5b08a18 QtNfc: Remove dependency on QtNetwork  
QtNfc no longer depends on QtNetwork.  
  
* 734638bc QBluetoothAddress: add qHash() as a proper hidden friend  
Added qHash().  
  
* 195f1baf QBluetoothUuid: remove default case labels and fix the  
fallout  
Fixed missing result of  
characteristicToString(CharacteristicType::WeightScaleFeature).  
  
* 246dfef3 QBluetoothUuid: inherit all ctors from QUuid  
QBluetoothUuid now provides all the constructors that QUuid also  
provides (incl. from GUID and QAnyStringView).  
  
### qtwayland  
* db4afd9c client: Fix infinite recursion with text-input-v2  
Fixed a possible crash when editing a field in an item view.  
  
* 0088b09e compositor: Fix crash when raising shell surface item  
Fixed an issue where the compositor would sometimes crash if a shell  
surface item was brought to front.  
  
### qt3d  
* b41f852e1 Create materials with normal textures in Assimp importer  
The scene importer now creates materials that support normal textures  
if the loaded scene has some.  
  
* 6fc59847c Texture array support for RHI renderer  
Enable texture array on the RHI render plugin  
  
### qtimageformats  
* feb7864 TGA Plugin: Fix reading of CMapDepth  
Fixed reading of TGA files with a non-zero X-origin  
  
* 3cba6d1 Update bundled libwebp to version 1.3.0  
Update bundled libwebp to version 1.3.0  
  
* da0158c Update bundled libtiff to version 4.5.0  
Bundled libtiff was updated to version 4.5.0  
  
* 5464b86 Update bundled libtiff to version 4.5.1  
Bundled libtiff was updated to version 4.5.1  
  
* 4496d03 Update bundled libwebp to version 1.3.1  
Update bundled libwebp to version 1.3.1  
  
* 4f638bc Update bundled libwebp to version 1.3.2  
Update bundled libwebp to version 1.3.2  
  
* db221e4 Update bundled libtiff to version 4.6.0  
Bundled libtiff was updated to version 4.6.0  
  
### qtwebsockets  
* da30f70 Support 401 response for websocket connections  
QWebSocket now supports 401 Unauthorized. Connect to the  
authenticationRequired signal to handle authentication challenges, or  
pass your credentials along with the URL.  
  
### qtwebchannel  
* 48d2066 Fix project structure and auto registry  
Created new QtWebChannelQuick which holds qml sources.  
  
### qtwebengine  
* 876f11854 Disable WebEngineContext dump by default  
Disabled WebEngineContext dump by default.  
  
* 000f31fb6 Add qWebEngineGetDomainAndRegistry()  
Add qWebEngineGetDomainAndRegistry()  
  
* 1aa2a71e3 Add QWebEnginePage::devToolsId()  
Add devToolsId property  
  
* 4a26a7b92 RenderWidgetHostViewQtDelegateItem: keep grabs  
WebEngineView (or WebView backed by Qt WebEngine) no longer allows  
components outside to take over the mouse or touch exclusive grab. For  
example if the user starts dragging a scrollbar inside the web view,  
that continues until release, regardless of any DragHandler, Flickable  
etc.  
  
### qtvirtualkeyboard  
* cfc77fbd Make qvirtualkeyboardnamespace.h private  
The qvirtualkeyboardnamespace.h header has been made private. None of  
the enum types declared in that header are used in public C++ APIs.  
  
* d435fdf2 Restore style path for backwards compatibility  
Restored style path /QtQuick/VirtualKeyboard/content/styles for  
backwards compatibility.  
  
### qtspeech  
* c03afcc Add QTextToSpeech::synthesize to produce PCM data rather than  
audio  
Added the ability to produce PCM data as a QByteArray. The  
QtTextToSpeech module now depends on QtMultimedia on all platforms.  
  
### qtnetworkauth  
* 32f29d3 Improve error handling and reporting in OAuth2  
Add token request error signal and improve related error handling  
  
### qtquick3d  
* 72f7a4fe Change API to follow QtQuick3DPhysics  
HeightFieldGeometry::heightMap is deprecated and replaced with  
HeightFieldGeometry::source.  
  
* 4f86bb24 Mark types in QtQuick3D.Effects as deprecated  
The pre-made post-processing effects inherited from Qt 3D Studio and  
its predecessors are now marked as deprecated. They are still available  
for use, but new projects are encouraged to use the 3D post-processing  
facilities provided by ExtendedSceneEnvironment and SceneEnvironment.  
Whereas 2D effects that operate on and treat the output of the View3D as  
a simple 2D image, are recommended to be implemented via Qt Quick's  
facilities, such as the new MultiEffect type or the Qt Quick Effect  
Maker tool.  
  
### qtgrpc  
* 2682cbb Reuse the existing message value when deserializing it second  
time from the wire  
Initialized message fields of the message type are reused when  
deserializinng the message. Previously message fields of the message  
type were deserialized to a freshly created message object. This change  
removes creating of the new message object at each deserialization cycle  
and reuses the exising field value if it's not 'null'. If fields of this  
message object are received from wire they will be overritten, if not  
they will store the previous value.  
  
* 3b8b24c Introduce QGrpcCallOptions and QGrpcChannelOptions  
Add QGrpcChannelOptions to store and process channel options and  
default call options.  
  
* dab5983 Remove QGrpcInsecureCredentials  
Removed QGrpcInsecureCredentials. Now insecure connection is default  
option for QGrpcChannelOptions and QGrpcCallOptions.  
  
* aed606e Remove QGrpcSslCredentials  
Removed QGrpcSslCredentials. Please use  
QGrpcChannelOptions::withSslConfiguration() to setup QSslConfiguration  
for the channel.  
  
* f57775c Remove QGrpcUserPasswordCredentials  
Removed QGrpcUserPasswordCredentials. Now user and password credentials  
can be added by using QGrpcMetadata.  
  
* e7da8ab Migrate to the implicitly shared data for protobuf messages  
Move-from protobuf messages now become invalid after the move  
operations and cannot continue to be used.  
  
* 96397a5 Remove silent reconnection to grpc server stream  
Client HTTP/2 channel doesn't retry to start server-stream  
automatically after connection is lost, since this contradicts gRPC  
streaming concepts. The error should be handled by business logic of an  
application instead.  
  
### qtvncserver (Commercial only)  
* c5319b2 Provide more information about connection state  
Replaced the connectionActive/isConnected properties with a serverState  
property that allow you to also track whether the server successfully  
initialized or not.
